# Titanic-ML-project

This repository contains my data science project which I completed for my Data Science Internship with Inmovidu Technologies Pvt Ltd.
The aim of the project was to accurately predict if a passenger on the Titanic survived or not on basis of the independent variables like age,passenger class,gender etc.
The project was handled in two parts.
The first part consisted of cleaning and exploratory analysis of the data.
The second part consisted of using machine learning algorithms to obtain the best possible accuracy for the survival classification.
This project was a Supervised Learning ML project.
The dataset was provided by our mentor.
